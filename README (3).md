2016 US Election Analysis for Democratic Party Strategy
Project Overview
This project analyzes the 2016 US presidential primary election data alongside comprehensive county-level demographic and economic information to help the Democratic Party understand what happened in 2016 and develop effective strategies for the 2020 election. The analysis identifies key demographic and geographic patterns of Trump support and recommends targeted approaches for Democratic messaging and outreach.
Data Sources
The analysis is based on three primary datasets:

primary_results.csv: Contains county-level primary election results with vote counts and percentages for all candidates
county_facts.csv: Provides detailed demographic, social, and economic data for all US counties
county_facts_dictionary.csv: Includes descriptions of the variables in the county_facts dataset

Feature Engineering
The project creates several composite variables to capture complex socioeconomic factors:

Socioeconomic Status (SES) Score: Combines education, income, and housing values
Economic Wellbeing Index: Measures prosperity as a function of income relative to poverty rates
Global Integration Score: Quantifies international connectivity through foreign-born population and non-English speakers
Female Representation Power: Measures women's economic empowerment relative to population
Entrepreneurship Rate: Calculates business ownership per capita
Age Index: Shows the ratio of seniors to youth in each county
Housing Affordability Index: Compares income to housing costs

Key Visualizations
The analysis includes multiple advanced visualizations:

Education and Income vs. Vote Share: Scatter plots showing how education and income levels relate to candidate support
Trump Support by Education-Income Matrix: Heat map showing interaction effects of education and income on Trump voting
Rural-Urban Vote Distribution: Log-scale scatter plot revealing stark differences in voting patterns based on population density
SES Score Comparison: County-level bar charts highlighting socioeconomic differences between Republican and Democratic voters
Entrepreneurship Rate Comparison: Analysis of business ownership patterns and political preference
Demographic Correlation Heatmaps: Visualizing relationships between demographic factors separately for Republican and Democratic counties
Boxplots by Candidate: Comparing demographic distributions across different candidates' supporters
K-Means Clustering: PCA-reduced visualization of Republican voter segments

Key Findings
Trump Supporter Characteristics

Higher concentration in counties with above-average white population
Lower average college education levels
Higher proportion of seniors (65+)
Mixed income profile with strength in both working-class and affluent areas
Lower global integration scores
Higher entrepreneurship rates in certain segments

Geographic Patterns

Strong Trump performance in rural and small-town America
Clear urban-rural divide in voting patterns
Significant strength in formerly industrial regions

Economic Factors

Economic anxiety correlates with Trump support in specific regional contexts
Housing affordability challenges show meaningful patterns across the electoral map
Manufacturing decline areas show particularly strong Trump support

Strategic Recommendations for Democrats
Based on data analysis, the project recommends several approaches for 2020:

Geographic Targeting:

Focus resources on swing states with close margins in 2016
Develop specific outreach strategies for rural and small-town communities
Target counties with demographic shifts favorable to Democrats


Demographic Focus:

Increase youth turnout in areas with high young population but low participation
Address economic concerns in working-class communities
Engage minority communities where turnout was below potential


Economic Messaging:

Develop economic revitalization plans for former manufacturing regions
Address housing affordability concerns in key swing districts
Highlight entrepreneurship and small business support


Turnout Strategy:

Identify districts where Democrats received high vote shares but still lost
Analyze and counter Republican messaging in competitive districts
Implement targeted get-out-the-vote efforts in areas with low participation



Technical Implementation
The project employs several data science techniques:

Pandas for data manipulation and feature engineering
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and feature importance analysis
Statistical analysis to identify significant demographic patterns

Future Work
Future extensions could include:

Incorporating 2018 midterm results to identify shifting trends
Developing predictive models for 2020 county-level outcomes
Creating interactive dashboards for campaign strategy planning
Adding time-series economic data to better understand regional economic changes

Conclusion
This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for understanding the 2016 election dynamics and offers concrete recommendations for developing an effective Democratic strategy for 2020. By understanding the demographic, economic, and geographic factors that influenced the 2016 outcome, the Democratic Party can develop more targeted and effective outreach and messaging strategies.
